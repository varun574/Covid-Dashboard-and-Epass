# Project Description

This project showcases how you create a static dashboard that update regularly and contains 
information from every country on what percent of COVID cases and deaths have been 
reported. The content of this dashboard shows statistics and reports regarding Covid-19. 
In order to contain the spread of the corona virus, the state governments are taking various 
necessary steps. One such step that the governments are doing is imposing lockdown. 
During this, the movement of people in case of emergency or essential activities such as 
medical treatment and certain business needs will happen by getting an approval from the 
respective state governments. An E-Pass is what will be issued in such cases. An e-Pass is an 
indicator that you have permission to step outside and travel due to the nature of your work. 
In our project we have included E-Pass registration process during which certain important 
elements will be collected from the person who needs to travel and either approve or reject 
based on the norms of the respective state government. In either case an email and a SMS 
will be sent to the person. There is a provision also included to track the status of the e-pass 
application using the generated reference id.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
